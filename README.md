# SimpleDecoder
Simple mp3 decoder. Simple here means using derivative works to learn and understand how to build an mp3 decoder. Purpose of which is to also write understandable code that is more verbose so that I give back to the community more easier to understand code.  This is for educational purpose for others and myself but can be used in any creative ways.

## TODO and Notes:
This is a sample starting readme and is by no means complete. Additional information and citations of sources used in building and understanding this decoder will be included.
Essentially thisi Readmen is work in progress and any information contained is currently tentative and subject to change. I.e This is a quick readme and I will fix it later :)
