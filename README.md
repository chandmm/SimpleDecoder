# SimpleDecoder
Simple mp3 decoder. Simple here means using derivative works to learn and understand how to build an mp3 decoder. Purpose of which is to also write understandable code that is more verbose so that I give back to the community more easier to understand code.  This is for educational purpose for others and myself but can be used in any creative ways.
